In this post, we share some notes about randomized algorithms and related ideas.

## Some random stuff

I spent some time the last few months looking for a Randomized Algorithms class to follow online. Luckily, I found the Randomized Algorithms class from UCSC, [CSE290A Spring 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXHr3CDAeWE&list=PLOQjlWvnI0faRpH2oJcyW4CuM5Clt8a2n), by Prof. Sesh Comandur. Iâ€™d the pleasure to meet him in person while I was studying at UCSC. I attended and enjoyed his Analysis of Boolean Functions class when I was in SC, so I decided to watch the lectures from his class. 

This post will be an attempt to share a summary of what I consider the most important and interesting ideas from the lectures.

## Some important concentration inequalities

- **Markov's inequality**: given a non-negative random variable $X$ and $a > 0$, then $P[X > a] < E[X]/a$

Until our next post colegas,
